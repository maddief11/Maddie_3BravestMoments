          <p class="lead">I had grown up playing many different sports, but could not find one that I loved to play. I was introduced to volleyball in gym class in the fifth grade, and my teacher noticed that I had a special talent for the sport. I decided to try out for a club volleyball team for the first time the following year, in the sixth grade. I was very nervous that I would not be as skilled as the other girls, but I ended up loving the sport and have been playing it ever since. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Getting my Cartilage Pierced </h2>
          <p class="lead">For a good portion of my sophomore year of high school, I decided I wanted to pierce my cartilage in my ear. I really wanted something new, because I was bored with myself. I did not want to cut or dye my hair, so I decided a new piercing would be best. Once, I finally convinced my mom, the reality of the piercing hit. I became very nervous about going to a tattoo shop and the pain that I would have to endure. Even though I was nervous, I went through with the piercing, and it did not hurt as bad as I thought. Now, I love the piercing and am glad I got it done.  </p>

          <p class="lead">I was very nervous for my first day of high school. I was going to be taking an AP class my freshman year, meaning I would be in class with many upperclassmen. I was debating dropping the class, because I was very nervous about taking such an upper level class. However, I had other friends taking the class as well, so I knew we would all understand the struggle. I decided to stick with the class and I ended up having a great time. </p>
